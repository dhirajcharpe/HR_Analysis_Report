I recently had the opportunity to work on an insightful HR Analytics Dashboard. Goal was to uncover key trends and insights that can help improve employee retention and satisfaction.

üîç Key Insights from the HR Analytics Dashboard:
Age Factor: Most employees who leave the company are between the ages of 26 and 35.

Job Role Impact: The highest turnover rates are seen in Life Sciences Education and Laboratory Technician roles.

Tenure Trends: Employees with 1 to 2 years of tenure are more likely to leave compared to others.

Salary Insights: Although the average salary is 6.5k, those earning less than this amount are more likely to leave the company.

üìä Dashboard Highlights:
Interactive Visualizations: Easily drill down into specific data points to uncover deeper insights.
Trend Analysis: Understand patterns over time to make data-driven decisions.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed to be intuitive for HR professionals to navigate and use.

This project not only showcases the power of data visualization with Power BI but also emphasizes the importance of understanding employee dynamics to foster a better work environment.
